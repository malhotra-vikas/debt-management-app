This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

After the server restarts, run the following commands to check:

For Nginx:

bash
Copy code
sudo systemctl status nginx
Ensure Nginx is active and running.

For PM2:

bash
Copy code
pm2 list
Ensure your app (dealing-with-debt) is listed as online.


Monitor Logs
To view the logs for your app and ensure it's running as expected:

bash
Copy code
pm2 logs dealing-with-debt

Recap
Nginx: Verified that it starts on boot (sudo systemctl enable nginx is already configured).
PM2:
Started the app with pm2 start.
Saved the process list with pm2 save.
Enabled PM2 startup with pm2 startup.
```
