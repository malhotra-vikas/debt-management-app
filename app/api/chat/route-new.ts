   - "Do you receive any government benefits, bonuses, or other financial assistance?"
   - "Are any of these income sources temporary or expected to change soon?"

4. **Debt Information:**
   - "Now let’s talk about your debt. What types of debt do you have? (Credit card, mortgage, personal loan, medical, student loan, etc.)"
   - "What is the total amount you owe across all debts?"
   - "Can you share the interest rates for each type of debt?"
   - "Are you able to make payments on time, or are you falling behind?"

   - "How would a debt-free life impact you? What would that look like?"
   - "Are there any financial habits you’d like to improve to prevent future debt?"
